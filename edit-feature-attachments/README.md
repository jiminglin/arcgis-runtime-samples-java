##How it works##
To get a `Feature` from a `ServiceFeatureTable` and add or delete `Attachment`:

1. Create a service feature table from a URL.
2. Create a `FeatureLayer` from the service feature table.
3. Select features from the feature layer, `FeatureLayer.selectFeatures()`.
4. To fetch the feature's attachments, cast to an `ArcGISFeature` and use`ArcGISFeature.fetchAttachmentsAsync()`.
5. To add an attachment to the selected ArcGISFeature, create an attachment and use `ArcGISFeature.addAttachmentAsync()`.
6. To delete an attachment from the selected ArcGISFeature, use the `ArcGISFeature.deleteAttachmentAsync()`.
7. After a change, apply the changes to the server using `ServiceFeatureTable.applyEditsAsync()`.
