##How it works##
To limit the `Feature`s in your `FeatureLayer`:

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.
2. Create a feature layer from the service feature table.
3. Set the limit of the features on your feature layer using `FeatureLayer.setDefinitionExpression(Expression)`.

##Features##
- ArcGISMap
- FeatureLayer
- MapView
- ServiceFeatureTable
