##How it works##
To display the `ArcGISMap`'s `Bookmark`s:

1. Create an ArcGIS map; it has a property called bookmarks.  
2. Create a `BookmarkList` from the ArcGIS map, `ArcGISMap.getBookmarks()`.
3. Set the map to the `MapView`, `MapView.setMap()`. 
4. To create a new bookmark
  - use `MapView.getCurrentViewpoint()` to set the bookmark's viewpoint 
  - bookmark.name for the name of the bookmark
  - add new bookmark to book mark list, `BookmarkList.add()`
