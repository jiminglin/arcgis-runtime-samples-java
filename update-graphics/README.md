#Update Graphics#
Demonstrates how to identify a Graphic and change it's symbol, attributes, and geometry. Geometry explains the  graphic's location on a map, a symbol controls how a graphic will be displayed to a map, and the attributes help store information about the graphic in a key value pair.

##How to use the sample##
Update Graphic's Location:
  - click on a graphic, then click the update location button
  - now click a new location on the map to move graphic

Update Graphic's Description:
  - click on a graphic, then click the update description button
  - enter a new description and click ok

Update Graphic's Symbol:
  - click on a graphic, then choose a symbol from the update symbol drop down box

##How it works##
How to change a `Graphic`'s symbol, attributes, and geometry:

1. Create a `GraphicsOverlay` and attach it to the `MapView`.
2. Create graphics using a `Point` and `SimpleMarkerSymbol`. 
  - point gives the x,y-coordinate location of where SimpleMarkerSymbol will be located
3. Add two Attributes to each graphic, `Graphic.getAttributes().put()`.
  - first attribute key NAME and value the name for that graphic
  - second attribute key DESCRIPTION and value a description for that graphic
4. Add graphics to the graphics overlay, `GraphicsOverlay.getGraphics().add(graphic)`.
5. Identify graphic that user has selected using `MapView.identifyGraphicsOverlayAsync(GraphicsOverlay,Point2D, tolerance, maximumResults)`.
  - graphics overlay, the one that was created above
  - point2D, from the user mouse click
  - tolerance, places buffer around the point2d
  - maxiumum result, sets the maximum amount of graphics to return near that point2d
6. Select graphic that user selected.
  - the identify will return a list of graphics
  - go through that list and set each graphic's selection to true, `Graphic.setSelected()`
7. To update graphic's location.
  - create a point from the user mouse click, `MapView.screenToLocation()`
  - set that point as the selected graphic's new geometry, `Graphic.setGeometry()`
8. To update graphic's attribute.
  - get attrubutes of selected graphic and set DESCRIPTION key, `Graphic.getAttributes().put("DESCRIPTION",)`
9. To update graphic's symbol.
  - get symbol from the drop down box
  - assign that symbol to the selected graphic, `Graphic.setSymbol()`
