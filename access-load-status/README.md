#Access Load Status#
Demonstrates how to tell what the ArcGISMap's load status is. An ArcGISMap is considered loaded once it has a valid SpatialReference and it has been set to the MapView.

##How it works##
To access the `ArcGISMap`'s `LoadStatus`:

1. Create an ArcGIS map.
2. Use `ArcGISMap.addLoadStatusChangedListener()` and `ArcGISMap.getNewLoadStatus()` to display the load status of the map.
3. Set the ArcGIS map to the `MapView` to began loading.
