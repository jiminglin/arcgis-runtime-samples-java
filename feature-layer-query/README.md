#Feature Layer Query#
Demonstrates how to query a FeatureLayer from a FeatureTable.

##How to use the sample##
Input the name of a U.S. state into search bar. When you hit search the application performs a query on the feature table and based on the result either highlights the state geometry or provides an error.

Note: The search is case sensitive.

##How it works##
To query a `Feature` from your `FeatureLayer`:

1. Create a `ServiceFeatureTable` from a URL.
2. Create a feature layer from the service feature table.
3. Create a `QueryParameters` object and specified the where clause on it with `QueryParameters.setWhereClause()` from the text entered by the user. 
4. Fire the query on the service feature table using `ServiceFeatureTable.queryFeaturesAsync(query)`.
5. Once complete get the feature's from the `FeatureQueryResult`.
